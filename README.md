# Save_user_info_with_Amazon_Lex_chatbot
This is project 4 of AI and AWS five series projects.
🚀 Building Smarter Chatbots with hashtag#AWSLex! 💡
As part of my AI x AWS journey, I just wrapped up an exciting project—teaching a chatbot how to remember user info securely! 🎯
In my first three projects, I explored:
✅ Defining intents & responses 💬
✅ Setting up custom slot types 🔀
✅ Connecting Lex with hashtag#AWSLambda 🤝
But in Project 4, I took it up a notch! 🏆
💡 The Challenge:
Chatbots can get annoying if they keep asking for the same details (like a birthday) within the same session. I wanted to fix that by enabling context carryover—allowing the bot to remember key details for follow-up questions!
🔹 My Solution:
✅ Implemented context tags to store and retrieve user data.
✅ Set up a FollowupCheckBalance intent to handle balance inquiries without re-asking for authentication.
✅ Configured Lex slots to reuse stored info, ensuring a seamless user experience.
🛠️ Tech Used: hashtag#AWSLex | hashtag#Lambda | hashtag#NLP | hashtag#AIChatbots
Now, the bot smartly remembers relevant details only for a short time (5 turns/90 sec) to balance convenience & security! 🔐
✨ This project reinforced my passion for building intelligent, user-friendly applications. As a hashtag#recentgraduate actively seeking hashtag#SoftwareEngineer roles, I’m eager to bring these skills to real-world products! 🚀
